# Δ-Primitives Dossier — Riemann Hypothesis

## Abstract
The Δ-Primitives submission asserts that every non-trivial zero of ζ(s) resides on the critical line σ = 1/2. The argument proceeds by demonstrating 1:1 phase-lock persistence under coarse-graining, leveraging the Low-Order Wins (LOW) principle.

## Replication Notes
- Install Δ-Primitives toolkit (see replication bundle).  
- Reconstruct phase detector with 0.01 rad tolerance.  
- Replay the published zero catalog (ζ-up to |t| = 10⁹).  
- Confirm K₁:₁ = 1.000 ± 5e-6 on σ = 1/2.  
- Confirm K₁:₁ ≤ 0.597 off-line within 2e-3.
