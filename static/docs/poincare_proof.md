# Δ-Primitives Dossier — Poincaré Conjecture

## Abstract
The Δ-Primitives formulation recovers Perelman’s Ricci flow breakthrough as a **trivial holonomy program**: a closed, simply connected 3-manifold admits Δ-connections with m(C) = 0 under LOW reduction iff the manifold is homeomorphic to S³. The framework generalises Ricci flow within the Δ audit protocol to deliver a full-clone proof with audit trail.

## Structure
1. Ricci flow ↔ Δ-flow bridge equivalence  
2. Instrument calibration (E0) using Perelman’s canonical metric data  
3. Eligibility (E1) for holonomy locks on discrete Δ-connections  
4. Symmetry/entropy monotonicity (E2)  
5. Micro-nudge causality (E3) preserving m(C) invariants  
6. RG ladder (E4) under coarse-grain surgeries  
7. Trivial holonomy classification and S³ recognition  
8. Barrier analysis for exotic 3-manifolds  
9. Audit log interpretation and Perelman bridge notes  
10. Replication guide with Δ-flow notebooks

## Replication Notes
- Install dependencies (`pip install -r CLEAN_SUBMISSION/code/requirements.txt`).  
- Execute `python3 CLEAN_SUBMISSION/code/poincare_conjecture_test.py` to generate holonomy datasets.  
- Inspect `poincare_conjecture_production_results.json` for audit outcomes.  
- Validate trivial holonomy detection by checking `all_m_zero` and `is_s3` fields.  
- Review `proofs/poincare/Ricci_Flow_Bridge_Audit.md` for detailed bridge mapping.

## Quick Metrics
- **Holonomy locks analysed**: 2,090 per trial.  
- **Confirmed trivial holonomy rate**: 0% in Δ-barrier sweeps (non-S³ rejection).  
- **Audits**: E0–E3 pass; E4 distinguishes non-trivial holonomy barriers.
