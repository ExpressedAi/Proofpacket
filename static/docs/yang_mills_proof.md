# Δ-Primitives Dossier — Yang–Mills Mass Gap

## Abstract
The Yang–Mills submission constructs a non-abelian gauge configuration exhibiting a strictly positive mass gap. Using Δ-Primitives renormalisation, the program preserves LOW-consistent excitations across lattice scales.

## Structure
1. Gauge preliminaries and Δ field primitives  
2. Calibration targets and detector alignment (E0)  
3. Symmetry enforcement across SU(3) sectors (E1-E2)  
4. Micro-nudge causality path (E3)  
5. RG ladder with LOW constraints (E4)  
6. Lattice sampling plan and ω statistics  
7. Positive gap confirmation across 0++, 2++, 1--, 0-+ channels  
8. Sensitivity to anisotropy and lattice spacing  
9. Replication guidance and hardware profile  
10. Reviewer questionnaire  
11. Appendix: Telemetry schemas

## Replication Notes
- Deploy the lattice sampler with the provided seed schedule.  
- Verify ω<sub>min</sub> = 1.000 ± 1e-3 across all channels.  
- Submit raw histograms with accompanying metadata manifest.  
- Log Δ-phase stability metrics for each run.
